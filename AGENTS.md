## Project Rules

- Agents must strictly abide by the rules, humans might not.
- Keep the CHANGELOG.md up to date.
- Write docs for each feature. They should be kept simple enough for non technical users wanting to understand how ssg works. e.g.
	- docs/features/markdown.md should explain how we approach markdown rendering.
- Don't add TODO comments to the codebase, instead use the TASKS.md to track upcoming work.
- Run `bun run build` before pushing commits to origin. App must build.
- All commits should use conventional commits
